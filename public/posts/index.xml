      <description>What if you are given a problem where you have to add two integers but you can&amp;rsquo;t use any arithmetic operators (+ - * / % // **), like LeetCode&amp;rsquo;s problem #371.

      <description>There are lots of extensions out there that turn your web browsing experience much better if you prefer dark backgrounds (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t right?).
My favourite one is Dark Reader but there&amp;rsquo;s just one problem, mobile versions of chrome don&amp;rsquo;t support extensions.
This trick will help you turn on dark mode everywhere.
Steps:
Visit Chrome flags by entering chrome://flags/ into the address bar.
Search for dark in the flags search bar.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the coolest thing about open source software? üí≠ If you need a new feature, you can just go ahead and add it yourself! Here are some tips I learned along the way:
Add Value Make sure your contribution adds value to the project. Don&amp;rsquo;t just contribute because it&amp;rsquo;s trendy.
Ask for Help Don&amp;rsquo;t expect to get everything right on the first try. Ask the project maintainers for feedback and guidance.</description>

      <description>What is an Algorithm and how does it differ from a Program? An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions that define how a task should be performed. In programming, algorithms are fundamental as they define the logic that computers must follow to solve specific problems.
A program is the implementation of one or more algorithms in a specific programming language. While an algorithm can be represented in many ways, a program is a concrete artifact that can be executed by a computer.</description>

      <description>Introduction Many tutorials show you how to create a basic Python app with a couple of modules, but they rarely explain how to set up a whole project.
This guide will show you how to set up a simple Python project with automated testing and a virtual environment for 3rd party packages. I have based it on Dead Simple Python: Project Structure and Imports by Jason C. McDonald with some opinionated changes.</description>
