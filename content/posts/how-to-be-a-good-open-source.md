## What's the coolest thing about open source software? 💭

If you need a new feature, you can just go ahead and add it yourself!
Here are some tips I learned along the way:

### Add Value

Make sure your contribution adds value to the project. Don't just contribute because it's trendy.

### Ask for Help

Don't expect to get everything right on the first try. Ask the project maintainers for feedback and guidance.

### Be Patient

Remember, many open source projects are labors of love. Be patient if things take time or responses are slow.

### Accept Rejection

 Sometimes your ideas might not fit with the project's goals. Be polite and be prepared to fork the project if necessary (and maybe even become a maintainer yourself!).

Most importantly, be a good open sourcerer, and may the code be with you! 🖖
