There are lots of extensions out there that turn your web browsing experience much better if you prefer dark backgrounds (who doesn't right?).

My favourite one is [Dark Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh) but there's just one problem, mobile versions of chrome don't support extensions.

This trick will help you turn on dark mode everywhere.

Steps:

1. Visit Chrome flags by entering `chrome://flags/` into the address bar.

2. Search for dark in the flags search bar.

3. On desktop versions you'll have to enable the flag "Force Dark Mode for Web Contents" which is tagged `#enable-force-dark`.
On Android versions you'll have to enable the flag "Darken websites checkbox in themes setting" which is tagged `#darken-websites-checkbox-in-themes-setting`.

4. Restart Chrome and enjoy the dark side.

That's all, Thank you for reading.
Hopefully this post was helpful to you, see you in the next one.
