## Are you planning to go abroad? Beware of these scams!!
<b><h6>Source : Reddit</h6></b>

There are common scams running in Nepal for those going abroad. All done through informal channel so take these information to be aware.

1. Females goes on dependent with Male as Student: Women got together with male in abroad with a promise to work and pay the men's uni fee. In the middle of the study they file divorce. Women get to go abroad and get half of the male's parental property. They even claim of domestic violence. Forget about paying uni fees, you will be paying alimony. When Men get OPT or TR, women ask to pay more alimony because of increase in the salary.

2. Male goes on dependent with Female as Student: Man have to bear all the cost from processing the marriage to uni fees. Around the end of the final semester after all the uni fees are paid, female file for divorce thus status of man is on limbo. After that man have to either find uni or return back. This does not stop there. Women also file for domestic violence and marital rape cases and family torture and ask for more than half of the property. In this case, man in addition to loan they took for the study have to pay alimony or divide property. Women get both property and free uni education.

3. PR Men marrying Nepali Women: There is another common scam going on in Nepal. Nepali women at early 20s are marrying Men with significant age gap but with Permanent Resident or Green card. Women be it in Nepal or Abroad, many such guy for the direct permanent residentship. In addition to getting opportunity to go abroad they also get direct PR/Green Card. Marriage need to be of at least 2 years, they wait for 2-3 years, and boom divorce them. Men think they got wives but they just became PR mill for the women. Again these women ask for property and gold in Nepal, alimony in abroad and go to enjoy their life with their actual boyfriend. Easy money, Easy PR.

Those three cases of US/UK/CA/AUS/NZ. There are some other cases such as marrying a decent guy, going abroad with his money and eloping in Japan/Israel and leaving the husband in strand in Nepal. Husband pay for everything women take the advantage and elope. There are also cases where men going to arab and Malaysia come and marry women, those wives enjoy all the remittance they get. They refuse to have baby when men come back to Nepal. Once they extort sufficient money, they file for divorce, wait till settlement and marry their actual boyfriend. They know if they are seen with another guy before settlement, they won't get penny thus use such tactic. Women are abusing these laws. I/NGOs women even help them to further extort as mush as possible so they also get share of free money pie.

Dowry has not been abolished in Nepal. Now, Male gives dowry and share of their hard earned and inherited wealth to vulture women aided by women of I/NGOs and corrupt lawyers.

So, if you two are from very different socio economic background and your two family do not know each other well, do not get engaged. Beware of such daily scams being carried out by morally flexible desperate lower socioeconomic background or elitist women in Nepal and abroad. So do not happy if you suddenly see someone from lower socioeconomic background girl being suddenly interested in you, their intention is to get quick money in abroad and enjoy.

Ask and contact divorce lawyers to know what types of cases are pending and happening currently in Nepal. Protect your assets. If you find these weird because either you or your closed one have not seen this or you are not in those socioeconomic background .


### Marrying just to go abroad is so rampant in Nepal.

It makes my head hurt thinking how can someone gamble their life that just to go abroad. The situation is so grim that people are rejecting excellent proposals form Nepal to marry someone vastly different to them just because they are abroad.

A girl I know married this December to a much much older guy. The girl was beautiful. She was getting good marriage proposals. But the guy she chose to marry lived in Japan. By March, in 3 months their marriage was in shambles.

A boy from somewhere in Nepal, handsome, good personality, comes from a well off family sent marriage proposal to a girl. They knew each other from Instagram. She declined the proposal saying she isn't ready to marry for next 2 years. Few months later what he hear, she is getting married to a guy living in Canada. Thought the guy cancelled the marriage for some unknown reasons.


<h5>Young girl are taking advantage of men's hard work and toil. They will leave thier 4-5 year long realtionship to go abroad and settle fast. If you were in relationship and married or if you were single and married around your age that is fine. But leaving your long term relationship to marry anyone without knowing character.
It is not only women, knowing women are marrying for their abroad status, incel are doing this too. They will leave their long term girlfriend just to marry young women because they know they can get young women. If both of them were single, that is another story. Incle men and desperate women are doing divorce in mass because that was never a true marriage for them.</h5>
