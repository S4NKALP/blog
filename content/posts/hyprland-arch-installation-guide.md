#### ‚ô®Ô∏è Adjusting fonts sizes and font scaling including waybar fonts
- nwg-look is a very good app. Use it to adjust your own preference.
- HiDPI users, I suggest you do the following to have a better appearance.
- > adjust scaling according to your taste by editing ~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/Monitors.conf
- > adjust font size using nwg-look (GTK Settings)
- > You can tweak the fonts scaling in Font tab in nwg-look

  - In Generaral, costumize your own dots in `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs`
  - files located in this folder can be edited using editor of your choice.


#### üß≤ notes for nvidia gpu users
  - Do note that you need to enable or disable some items in ENVariables.conf file located in `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ENVariables.conf`
  - a guide on wiki - https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/

#### üí° Reducing cpu usages / Battery saving
